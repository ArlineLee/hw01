### Brief Biography Arline  
My name is Arline Lee. I am a museum science teacher. I am unabashedly and unironically a huge fan of: 
* **Science Fiction**  
   + I have recently come around to some genre permeability with fantasy
      + If anyone is interested N.K. Jemisin's *The Fifth Seasson* is a perfect example of "hard sci-fi" fantasy. 
  + My favorite series is *Deep Space Nine*, but Captain Janeway is my favorite captain 
   + here is the link to watch the best Trek while stuck inside. [You'll thank me](https://www.netflix.com/title/70158330?source=35) 
* **Romantic comedies**
    + Before you ask, it's *You've Got Mail* and I do not like *Sleepless in Seattle*

I love travelling--before coming to the MAPSS program, I travelled for four months--one of my favorite places was Georgia--but I didn't take any photos of me there so here's one from Armenia.

Right now, my GitHub workflow is probably a little clunky. Since i am working on specific, small skills, I am constantly pushing it to Git to see if my code did what I wanted it to do. I have so many pushes for this assignment! I'm a little worried moving forward about not being to see if what I have written works as I go, but I'm sure I'll get used to it.  
RMarkdown right now seems a tad overwhelming with all of the commands--I just need to remember that it is a different language! So far, these kinds of commands seem simple enough though.
