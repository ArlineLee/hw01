### Brief Biography Arline  
My name is Arline Lee. I am a museum science teacher. I am unabashedly and unironically a huge fan of: 
* **Science Fiction**  
   + I have recently come around to some genre permeability with fantasy
  + My favorite series is *Deep Space Nine*, but Captain Janeway is my favorite captain 
   + here is the link to watch the best Trek while stuck inside. [You'll thank me](https://www.netflix.com/title/70158330?source=35) 
* **Romantic comedies**
    + Before you ask, it's *You've Got Mail* and I do not like *Sleepless in Seattle*
